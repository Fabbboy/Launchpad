Download the latest release from the Github or join our Discord server and download the latest version there. Start the main.py in the console or use a IDE like PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, etc. Also you need the "Webtool", go in the Webtool folder and "start" the index.html (you can use for example XAMPP or any other **LOCALHOST** tools)

**‚ÄºÔ∏èIMPORTANT‚ÄºÔ∏è**:
The page has to be localhost otherwise your tokens won't react.

1. Create a file named tokens.txt and add in all tokens (no quotes befor and after the token, every token has his own line)
2. launch the Webtool
Finish

**‚ÄºÔ∏èIMPORTANT‚ÄºÔ∏è**

We recommend to use a VPN and do not use this on your primary discord account.

# FAQ's ‚ùì

**Is this a Discord bot?**

No, RaidLaunchpad is not a Discord Bot, it is a program to automate user accounts with their corresponding token.
**Can my tokens get phone-locked?**

We have successfully tested RaidLaunchpad against several scenarios. You are able to spam constantly for 15 hours before your tokens are locked. if you use our tool wisely, they should never get phone-locked.
